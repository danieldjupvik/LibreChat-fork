# Your rule content

Always remember that this is a forked repository and the upstream repo is actively maintained.
## To minimize the risk of merge conflicts:
- Make changes in a way that’s easy to maintain and merge.
- Avoid modifying upstream fileolutely necessary.
- Whenever possible, move custom code to separate files — for example, [custom-daniel-ai.css](mdc:client/src/custom-daniel-ai.css) or a similarly scoped file.
- Leave inline comments explaining why the change was made and referencing any relevant upstream issue, if applicable.
## When overriding behavior:
- Keep the logic as isolated as possible.
- Prefer extension over modification — e.g., wrapping components, overriding classes via higher specificity, or using CSS file for overriding if applicable.
