# Fork Rules

This is a forked repository. The upstream repo (danny-avila/LibreChat) is actively maintained.

**Always read [CLAUDE-FORK.md](mdc:CLAUDE-FORK.md) for fork-specific architecture, file locations, and LiteLLM/cost display details.**

## To minimize the risk of merge conflicts:
- Make changes in a way that's easy to maintain and merge.
- Avoid modifying upstream files directly unless absolutely necessary.
- Put custom code in isolated directories: `client/src/forked-code-custom/`, `client/src/forked-style-custom/`, `api/server/forked-code/`
- Custom backend routes go under `/api/forked/*`
- Leave inline comments explaining why the change was made.
## When overriding behavior:
- Keep the logic as isolated as possible.
- Prefer extension over modification — e.g., wrapping components, overriding classes via higher specificity, or using CSS file for overriding if applicable.
